        <p><em>Painter for <strong><a href="https://evanjustusart.com/">Evan Justus Art</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I’m Evan, an artist with a love for landscapes and for using color and imagination to create unique, beautiful worlds. <br><br> I grew up in McDonough, Georgia before I moved to Milledgeville to get my B.A. in Art from Georgia College &
          State University. I studied different forms of photography, printmaking, and painting, unable to focus solely on any one medium. However, one thing I was consistent in was my love for landscapes and seeing different interpretations of them,
          from Van Gogh’s Impressionist works to Thomas Kinkade’s Luminist worlds. Today, my heart is still set on creating landscapes that are inspired by fantasy films, video games, and real life places. Some of the media I tend to use are acrylic,
          oil, and watercolor paint as well as the occasional use of colored pencils and pastels. As I expand my skills and narrow down my individual style, I hope to continue to create new works and search for new places to get inspired.</p>
